flickpress is a tool to insert Flickr photos into your posts, plus a widget to
display recent Flickr photos.

== Description ==

flickpress adds a button to the post editor to insert Flickr photos into WordPress posts. Add Flickr users by entering their email addresses. Previously-entered Flickr users are stored in a database table - at Tools:flickpress users can be removed. Photos may be searched or browsed by recentness, tag, or photoset. Click through to a photo to insert a variety of sizes, adding the image's Flickr title as a caption if desired. In addition to browsing and searching specific users' photos, you may also search Flickr for Creative Commons, Flickr Commons, and government photos.

== Installation ==

1. Extract the plugin archive in your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, creating a 'flickpress' folder there.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Enter your Flickr API key at Settings:flickpress and configure other
options if desired.
4. If you wish to use the caption function, your theme should include some caption-related CSS - see the default theme for an example.

== Template Function ==

There is a simple template function available for use in your sidebar or other spots you'd like to include a few recent flickr photos. The function, its options, and the defaults are:
`flickpress_photos($email,$numphotos=3,$before='',$after='<br />',$fpclass='centered'`

== Widget ==

The widget just packages the template function in convenient widget form. To use it, activate it through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress and add it to your sidebar through the 'Widgets' menu. It requires some things in the main plugin, so you'll need to have both activated or it will not work.

Just like with the template function, you may specify a class for the images,
and text (such as HTML tags) to display before and after each image. Some tips:

* For a horizontal display, put nothing or just spaces before and after.
* For a vertical display, either use `<p>` before and `</p>` after or just a `<br />` after.
* Most themes include a class called "centered" that will center your images in the sidebar.
